# Overview

The Used Car Price Prediction Web App is a machine learning project that estimates the price of a used car based on various factors such as make, model, body type, year, engine type, fuel type, and transmission type. The model utilizes a dataset sourced from kaggle and employs machine learning algorithms to provide price estimates.

## Features

Price Prediction: Get an estimated price for a used car based on input parameters.

Data-driven Insights: Utilizes a comprehensive dataset to generate accurate predictions.

User-friendly Interface: Easy-to-use web interface for inputting car details and viewing predictions.

## Data Source

The historical data used in this project is sourced from kaggle. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/talhabarkaatahmad/pakistan-used-car-prices-2023).

## Model Details

The machine learning model used in this project is trained on historical car sales data, incorporating features such as make, model, body type, year of manufacture, engine type, fuel type, and transmission type. The model leverages XGBoost Regression algorithm to provide price estimates based on these inputs.

## Disclaimer

This car price prediction model provides estimated values based on input features and training data. However, the accuracy of these predictions may be limited due to low data points for some features and other inherent limitations of the model.
